<h2> How It's Made:</h2>

<h4>Tech Used: React, BootStrap, MaterialUI, RapidAPI </h4>
<p> A React Web Application that utlizes RapidAPI to pull workouts from a Workout API. The frontend is comprised of React.js and MaterialUI for styling and composing. 

<h2> Optimizations</h2>

<p> For this application I would optimize it by updating the individual workout page with videos to show users how to execute the workout with good form. The app would link to Youtube and look up related videos based on the exercise name.</p>

<h2> Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p> This application put the bulk of the concepts I learned from React in practice. Using different React Hooks help display the data from the Workout API. Also, MaterialUI helped build the bulk of the styling and responsiveness for my application.
