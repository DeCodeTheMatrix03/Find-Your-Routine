<h1> Find Your Next Routine</h1>

<p> 
  This is an online web application that allows you explore exercises for specific muscle groups. I built this application with the thought of helping someone fulfill their New Year's resolution!

<h2> How It's Made:</h2>

<h4>Tech Used: Ejs, BootStrap, Node.js, Express and MongoDB </h4>
<p> A FullStack Web Application that utlizes EJS as the templating language for the front end. The backend is compirsed of Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Passport.js (authentication) and other npm modules such as cloudinary for image storage, multer for mage upload and many more. Utilizing MVC architecture to ensure this application was not only performing well but also being able to debug and add features. </p>

<h2> Optimizations</h2>

<p> For this application I would optimize it by allowing videos to be uploaded as well. The app would need to accept video file type uploads, while also adding a feature that allows you to play the video.</p>

<h2> Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p> This application put the bulk of the concepts I learned into practice. Using MVC architecture to split up the code relating to the front-end, back-end and database was a huge advantage! Additionally, I was able to use passport.js to ensure authentication for actions such as deleting a post. I am looking forward to building more passion projects in the near future!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
